# Try to explore the difference between comparison operators in JavaScript and
# Python. Mainly, compare variables using `==` and `is` and see how they differ.
# Try using the `not` keyword and the `!` operator as well.

# x = 1
# y = '1'
# list1 = [1, 2]
# list2 = [1, 2]

# print(id(x))

# print(x == x)
# print(x is x)

# # Use the equality and identity comparison operators to compare:
# # 1. x with itself
# print(x != x, x is not x)
# # 2. x with y
# print(x != y, x is not y)
# # 3. list1 with list2
# print(list1 == list2, list1 is list2)

a = 1
print(a == True)  # don't do this, in Python 1 is equal in value to True
print(a is True)
