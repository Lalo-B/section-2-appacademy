# Week 12 Day 3: Security Basics

CORS, XSS, CSURF

---

Today's lecture will be structured differently than you are accustomed to
The short practices are AMAZING for demoing each topic, so the lectures will be very brief, and we let the SP do most of the work

---

# CORS

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Allows other apps to send requests to our API
- **Enforced by the browser**
- CORS policies are just middleware

---

# 20 mins for CORS SP

---

# XSS Attacks

- Cross-Site Scripting
- Being able to inject code into someone else's site
- Often used for malicious intent, but not always.
- Myspace is a great example

---

# 20 mins for XSS SP

---

#CSRF Attacks

- Cross-Site Resource Forgery
- When someone creates their own requests and tricks another user into sending that request
- Pretty common for XSS and CSRF attacks to happen together, but not always

# 20 mins for CSRF SP

## Time for you to work on the First 3 Phases of Auth Me!

- If you finish today's phases of Auth Me, do NOT move on to tomorrow's phases
- It is very important that they understand what each line is doing, and you won't know what tomorrow's is doing until after lecture
- Either work through the PostgreSQL exercise (highly recommend) or get a head start on HW
